Cookie Cookbook

Cookie Cookbook is a simple C# console application that lets users create and save cookie recipes. It’s built as part of the Ultimate C# Masterclass Assignment and demonstrates core programming concepts such as file I/O, enums, error handling, and user input processing.

Features

Interactive Recipe Creation:
Users can select ingredients from a predefined list to create their own cookie recipes.

Persistent Storage:
Recipes are stored in a text file, with each recipe neatly formatted for easy retrieval and display.

Modular & Readable Code:
Key functionalities like ingredient selection and recipe saving are encapsulated in separate methods, making the code maintainable and easy to understand.

How It Works

Display Existing Recipes:
When the app starts, it reads and displays any previously saved recipes from the Cookbook.txt file.

Create a New Recipe:
The user is prompted to create a new recipe by selecting ingredients from a menu.

Save the Recipe:
Once completed, the recipe is appended to the text file and confirmed on-screen.

Requirements: 
(1) .NET 9
(2) Basic knowledge of C#
